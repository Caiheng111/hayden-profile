Just starting out your first job as a software engineer? It definitely can be a nerve wracking experience not knowing what to expect or know if you'll even manage to do well in the role and reach expectations.

I'd like to share 5 lessons I've learned during my first year as a software engineer and is something I wish I would have known much earlier or simply lessons that have solidified for me over time.

## 1. The Importance of Soft Skills

When you think of web development, coding and technical acumen spring to mind. But the workplace taught me that soft skillsâ€”like communication, teamwork, and adaptabilityâ€”are equally essential.

Communication: Whether itâ€™s explaining your code to non-tech-savvy team members or asking the right questions to get the project requirements clear, effective communication is vital.

Teamwork: The synergy of a coordinated team amplifies the productivity and creativity of individual members. Learning to appreciate everyone's strengths and supporting their weaknesses is crucial.

Adaptability: In the fast-paced world of tech, change is the only constant. Being open to feedback, learning from mistakes, and being willing to adjust when necessary are key traits.


## 2. You Don't Know What You Don't Know

There's a vast array of tools, languages, and best practices in web development. As an intern, I realized there's so much I wasn't aware of. This was both overwhelming and exciting. It's essential to maintain the humility to admit when you don't know something and the curiosity to learn continuously.

## 3. Mentorship is Priceless


One of the most valuable aspects of my internship was the guidance I received from senior developers. They provided insights that I would not have gained from books or courses. Their feedback on my code, advice on best practices, and the wisdom they shared about navigating the tech industry were indispensable. I learned the importance of seeking out mentors and, in turn, giving back by mentoring others once I gained more experience.


## 4. Keep Learning

The tech world, especially web development, is ever-evolving. New tools, languages, and best practices emerge almost daily. As an intern, I was quickly exposed to the vastness of the web development landscape. At times, it felt like trying to drink from a firehose. However, I learned to embrace this constant change and use it as motivation. Continuous learning became my mantra.


Staying Updated: It's essential to keep an eye on the latest trends, not just to stay relevant but to provide the best solutions for the challenges at hand.


Asking Questions: There's no shame in admitting you don't know something. It's a starting point for growth. Every question I asked led to new knowledge.

Dedicated Learning Time: Setting aside regular time for learningâ€”whether it's taking a new course, attending workshops, or just practicingâ€”helps in keeping the skills sharp.


## 5. Keep going and don't give up

At times it might seem difficult and you may feel like giving up because you think you aren't cut out for software engineering, however keep pushing through and soon enough with each new experience, you will on the right road to growing in your career.

It might seem difficult, you might have trouble understanding the large codebase, have trouble working in an agile based team or face other issues on the journey but keep going and don't give up!

**Those are some of the important things I've personally learned during my first year, if anyone else has anything they've learned and would like to share that would benefit others and myself, I'd love to hear about them! ðŸ™‚**
